Building from the git repository
=====
To build this package from the git repository you will need a version of
autoconf >= 2.68 and a version of automake >= 1.11.1.  You will need to update
the submodule with ``git submodule init && git submodule update''.  You can put
these commands in your global 
$GIT_PREFIX/git/share/git-core/templates/hooks/post-checkout
script file to execute them for any checkout that occurs which includes the
initial clone. Once you have the prerequistes you can then do 
``autoreconf --install'' to create the needed configure file.  After that it is
the typical build process as follows with an assumption you've cloned the
repository to /usr/src/mingw.org-tools directory.

mkdir -p /usr/src/build/mingw.org-tools
cd /usr/src/build/mingw.org-tools
../../mingw.org-tools/configure --prefix=/mingw
make
make install
